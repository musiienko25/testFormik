Test Task: Create a Simple Contact Form

Objective: Build a contact form using React, Formik, and Material-UI. This task will help us assess your skills in using these technologies, as well as your overall front-end development capabilities.

Requirements:
Set up a new React project using create-react-app or a similar boilerplate.
Design a simple contact form that includes the following fields: name, email, and message.
Implement form validation using Formik. Ensure that all fields are required, and the email is in the correct format.
Style the form using Material-UI components and follow best practices for responsive design.
When the form is submitted, display a success message (no need to implement actual submission logic).

Submission:
Host the source code for your project on a public repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).
Provide the link to your repository in your submission.
